# Banana Web Store
This is the Banana Web Store page, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It's mostly a single-page site, using JS to show, hide, and replace components as needed. that's done to improve speed. The production version is at https://thebananastore.cf.

# Stuff used
> W3.CSS, a quality alternative to bootstrap that makes my job a whole lot easier
> 
> Font Awesome 4 Icons, they have some really nice icons.
> 
> The site is hosted by GitHub Pages, as it's free and we can use GH to edit the site with nice version control.
> 
> Domain from Freenom, that's why we have that weird .cf domain. It's free as again, we don't make money off this. Might do slight monetization, but NOT Google Ads. Just some small unobtrusive ads.
